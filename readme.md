# Community Choir Website

## Strategy

### Purpose

This is the website for a laid-back community choir. They hold events every week for anyone who wants to come along and join in. The website’s approach is designed to attract a younger demographic than would usually be associated with community singing. As the older demographic are typically active members of community choirs whether or not the choir has an online presence, this website will be designed to to appeal to a ‘mobile-first’ generation, which it is hoped will lead to the enrichment, both socially and musically, of the group itself with a more diverse membership.

### Who is it for?

Anyone who wants to sing for fun with other people. Joining a choir can feel like a big commitment, so The Anytime Choir’s focus is on being fun, casual and low-commitment. Anyone can turn up anytime!

### User stories

* “I want to meet new people and do something fun.”
* “I’ve never sung before, but it’s something I’ve always wanted to try.”
* “I don’t have time to commit to regular rehearsals with my local choir, but I love choral singing.”
* “I’ve heard that choir singing is great for your mental health, but isn’t it something that only older people do?”

The demographic breakdown of these events tends to favour women of early retirement age. Around a quarter of attendees are men aged 55+, and we have only a handful of under-35s (mainly female).

The choir’s leaders teach at folk and alternative festivals over the summer, and this is an excellent environment in which to connect with younger potential attendees. However, early buy-in is necessary with this age-group, who tend to be busy and active in multiple communities, so can not be relied upon to look up our events when they are next in front of a desktop machine.

We already have a highly engaged mailing list within the older demographic; those who plan further ahead and are happy to email or phone for information. The under-25s are far more impulsive and want access to basic information quickly and easily. Therefore it is essential that this facility is available to them on-the-go, in an accessible, mobile-first format.



### What is the site’s value to the user?

The site gives users the information they want in a simple and clear format. It is a single-scroll page to reduce the need to wait for further information to load when the user is out and about. The user can jump to relevant sections and find what they need in seconds. This gives them the ability to get involved when they feel compelled to do so, rather than missing out as life takes over and they move on to other distractions.

### What is its value to me/the owner?

Running a choir of any kind can be an admin-heavy operation. Aside from the musical direction, administrating the group’s activities and welcoming new people can take a huge amount of time. The value of this site to the owner is in reducing this admin overhead by answering the questions potential members typically have, automating the new-member process and, potentially, creating a platform for the distribution of materials to the existing choir.

### Competitors

This website does not have ‘competitors’ in the strict sense of the word, as it is not a commercial project, but there will be other similar groups also open to new members, and most people do not have time to become involved in more than one choir community, so there is competition in that sense. Examples we can look to for inspiration (or otherwise!) include:


#### Singing Saturdays

A monthly meet-up for all-comers in Oxford, UK. Different teachers and locations every month. This is not a formal choir, with a ‘fixed’ membership, but is open to anyone who wishes to join for each event.

The initial homepage view offers almost everything you’d want to know on first visiting the site. The callout — “Oxford’s fun, friendly, monthly singing sessions, meeting in the city’s most beautiful locations.” — tells us what this is, what the focus is, and when it is. The adjacent “Book online” indicates that it is open to anyone, and if we’re unsure we can easily navigate to the ‘About’ page in the navbar above. For anyone not certain but wanting to learn more, they can sign up to the newsletter or follow the event on Facebook. Just within view on loading is more information to scroll down to, which explains more about how these events work and why you might want to come to them.

Navigation around the site is obvious and intuitive. The links, however, when I visited the site, did not work quite as expected. Mostly they jumped to different parts of the homepage. This in itself was not a problem, but given that the information took up little space on the page, the user is forced to search for the information they are interested in. Though it may seem overcomplicated for such a simple site, this suggests it may be beneficial to separate this information, albeit limited in scope, to a separate page entirely with a clear and easy-to-read title.

Overall, the Singing Saturdays site brings the user value in that it answers questions easily and clearly, making the information easy to find in an intuitive and expected way, while incorporating culturally appropriate design (fun fonts, colour and bright, engaging photos).


#### Norwich Community Choir

A Norwich-based community choir open to all.

Though this website offers many of the basic information links that we see on the Singing Saturdays website shown above, this site fails the user in a number of ways:

This is a group that wishes to welcome new members, but its use of language could be off-putting to those nervous of joining a choir. For example, on the ‘About Us’ page the first sentence includes “highly committed” and “polished performances”, also the home page tells us that one needn’t be a good singer to join the group, which suggests that joining may not be a musically satisfying experience! 
The advert for the choir leader’s counselling service on the left-hand side is also a distraction.
The navigation section takes us quickly to different key information elements, but does so in an unnecessarily clunky way. The text is too small, and too wordy. The icons are unnecessary. Arguably, there are too many. 

Overall, the site fails its target audience in its presentation. I had to work quite hard to confirm that this was a group for both men and women. However, the majority of the images feature only women and the colour scheme is quite traditionally ‘female’ in a way that is now quite outdated. Having said that, this is probably a true reflection of the audience’s culture, though if they wish to attract new members it may be worth rethinking these design elements.



## Scope

### Key Features


Feature | Label | Feasibility (1-5) | Importance (1-5)
--------|-------|-------------------|-----------------
Basics - how we work, what we do, who we are | a | 5 | 5
Contact /sign-up form | b | 5 | 5
Future events/rehearsals |c | 5 | 5
Meeting times | d | 5 | 5 
Music download | e | 4 | 3
Links to songs to learn | f | 5 | 3
Shop - group t-shirts etc. | g | 1 | 1
Personnel page - key stakeholders etc | h | 4 | 2
Gallery | i | 5 | 5 
Blog - event write-ups, announcements | j | 2 | 1
Members’ area | k | 1 | 2
* Archives |
* Documentation |
* Membership database |
* Pay sub fees | 




Plotting the feasibility scores of potential features against their importance demonstrates that my focus should be on the following:

**High priority**
* Basics (who we are, what we do, where, etc.)
* Contact form
* Future Performances
* Meeting times
* Gallery

**Medium Priority (nice to have)**
* Sheet music download
* Links to recordings/videos
* Key personnel

We can clearly see that the following should not be attempted in the initial development of the site:

**Low priority (future development)**

* Online store
* Blog
* Members’ area


## Structure

As mentioned above in the Strategy section, this community choir wishes to broaden its member base out from the stereotypical over-50s female, while still being accessible to that demographic. The UK’s Office for National Statistics reported in 2020 that 97% of those in the 24 - 35 age bracket has Internet access via a smartphone, whereas those between 55 and 64 years of age only had smartphone-based Internet access in 74% of cases. The site will therefore be designed with the mobile-first methodology, to cater for a demographic with less time and poorer access to desktop or laptop devices. It will remain clear and accessible when viewed on a larger screen so that the site remains accessible and welcoming to all.

### Navigation
